    "A **series** is a one-dimensional array that can hold any type of data. We'll generally use the term to refer to a column in a dataset that's arranged in a table. In fact, this is the reason why, in the library [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), DataFrame columns are called `Series`. In a pandas Series, all items in the array must be the same data type.\n",

All other things being equal, we would expect most of the outcomes to fall in the middle of the possible range, with the number of outcomes diminishing on either side of the peak. In statistics, this is known as a *normal distribution*, but you may have heard it called a *bell curve*, because it looks like a bell. Here's an example:"

    "**Correlations** tell us about the relationship between two sets of data. When we calculate this relationship, the result is a **correlation coefficient**. Correlation coefficients can have any value between -1 and 1. Values above 0 indicate a positive relationship (as one variable goes up, the other does too), and values below 0 indicate a negative relationship (as one variable goes up, the other goes down). The closer the coefficient's value is to either 1 or -1, the stronger the relationship is; the closer the coefficient's value is to 0, the weaker the relationship is. Coefficients equal to 0 indicate that there is no relationship between the two values, and are accordingly quite rare.\n",
